How to test your language in the game itself:
1. Rename the original en.txt to something like "I like cats.txt";
2. Rename your edited language file to "en.txt";
3. Run the game and select english language;
4. The game thinks your language file is english, but its your edited language;

Characters:
- &% -> New line

- that "x" in rocket failures translations 
      -> don't remove it! It separates header and desc eachother

- that "," in modules translations 
      -> don't remove it! It separates header and desc eachother
