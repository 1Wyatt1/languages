How to test your language in the game itself:
1. Rename the original en.txt to something like "I like cats.txt";
2. Rename your edited language file to "en.txt";
3. Run the game and select english language;
4. The game thinks your language file is english, but its your edited language;

that "x" in tutorial and achievements translations -> don't remove it! It separates header and desc eachother
that "," in modules translations -> don't remove it! It separates header and desc eachother
