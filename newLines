news_FundraisingHats_header█{1} has sold 20,000 hats with the {0} logo. The perfect way to finance space business?
news_FundraisingHats_content█{1} is amazing. Crazy, but still amazing. {0}'s CEO was told by the management to add some cash to the company's budget in the sharpest possible way. A normal CEO would probably lay off a few employees to reduce the cost of hiring.&%&%{1} sold... hats. And quite a lot, almost 20,000. Is this the last such unusual act by {1}?

news_FundraisingBricks_header█"Hey, get a Brick!" - a surprising campaign of {0}.
news_FundraisingBricks_content█{1} did it again. Exactly. After this one we know that {0} is in very good hands, and bankruptcy is unlikely to happen.&%&%{1} decided this time to sell several thousand bricks to improve the financial flow of the company. An additional advantage is that the bricks are almost half the price of those competing. They are also ECO. From the first reports of the company we know that the bricks sell very good.

news_FundraisingNotFlamethrowers_header█The shipping companies have said that...
news_FundraisingNotFlamethrowers_content█... they will not transport anything that has "Flamethrower" in its name. What did {1} do? Of course he changed the name of them to "Not a Flamethrower".&%&%{1} has come up with another idea to make a few extra dollars. This time he made a huge lighter, sold in over 20,000 pieces! First rumors say he made over 30 million in cash. Something I feel that {0} is not afraid to go bankrupt anymore.


news_FundraisingRocketquilla_header█The fans of strong drinks have thrown themselves into an alcohol drinks from {0}.
news_FundraisingRocketquilla_content█Fans of clothing got hats, builders got cheap bricks, fanatics of TV-sized lighters got (not a)flamethrowers, and those who like to drink got... an explosive mixture of alcohol.&%&%Tequila in the rocket version from {1} has just made its market debut and... quickly sold out adding more than $100 million to the space company's pocket. Did you manage to buy it?
