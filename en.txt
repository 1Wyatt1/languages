welcome_notification█Hello, <color=#64B5F6>{0}</color>!&%I see you've finally set up the rocket company you've mentioned before. "<color=#64B5F6>{1}</color>" is actually a cool name! I have to tell you, you're very brave.&%&%Big companies that have a monopoly on the launch provider market have not invested in newer technology for years. They're still using inefficient boosters and obsolete engines. What if they could land their rockets back on Earth? Then it would be possible to send even a few payloads with only 1 rocket! I hope you can build a landing rocket or even a side booster rocket in few years.&%&%Good luck!
